# IA-Machine-Learning

IA-Machine-Learning is a hands-on machine learning study repository containing practical notebooks and exercises focused on data analysis, regression models, and real-world datasets.

The project documents the learning journey through progressively structured notebooks.

---

## Overview

This repository includes step-by-step machine learning exercises covering:

- Introduction to Machine Learning concepts
- Data exploration and visualization
- Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- Working with real datasets (e.g., movies, taxi data)
- Practical ML exercises

Each notebook builds on previous concepts to reinforce understanding.
